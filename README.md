# Devour-Da-Burger App

Devour-Da-Burger is a CRUD application that lets users keep track of the burgers they would like to eat and the burgers they have eaten. When a user submits a burger's name to eat later, the burger appears on the "Burgers To Eat" list. When a user submits a burger's name to eat now, the burger appears on the "Devoured Burgers" list. Users have the ability to create new burgers, move burgers between lists, and delete burgers.
